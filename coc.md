# Code of Conduct

## Purpose
A primary goal of SQL Server Community Slack is to be inclusive to the largest number of participants, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our Slack community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in our activities to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## Creating a Welcoming and Inclusive Culture
Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, please recognize their efforts.

## Expected Behavior
The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

- Be friendly. We all are seeking some form of SQL help in our careers at some point. We all were learning at one point. Some things that may be obvious to you might not be obvious to others. Avoid condescending tones.
- Be patient. Time zones are a funny thing. People might or might not respond to you in a timely manner. They could be helping to research your question, or sometimes people don't know and don't respond. Don't always expect immediate feedback or answers.
- Be welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
- Be considerate. Your work can be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.
- Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the SQL Server Community community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the SQL community.
- Be careful in the words that you choose. We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
    + Violent threats or language directed against another person.
    + Discriminatory jokes and language.
    + Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
    + Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
    + Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
    + Unwelcome sexual attention.
    + Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
    + Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
- When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and SQL is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of our community comes from its diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
- Moderators reserve the right to delete excessive self-promotional or commercial posts.
- Content that has been identified as objectionable, inappropriate, or off-topic will be subject to deletion by channel moderators. Posters will receive a warning and risk being blocked from the channel if unacceptable behavior persists.
- These decisions are made by SQL Server Community Slack administrators in its sole discretion.

## Unsolicited Engagement, Spam, and Scams
This community exists to support technical collaboration, mutual learning, and professional growth. Members must not use this space to solicit engagement for personal gain, promote unrelated products or services, or share deceptive content. This includes (but is not limited to) unsolicited direct messages, spam posts, promotional links, and scam attempts.

Such messages may be deleted without warning and further action may be taken at the discretion of the moderators.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including administrators and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, we may take any action deemed appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.
